# CPU Core Overview

XiangShan-2 (NANHU) support single-core and dual-core configurations, where each core has its own private L1/L2 cache. L3 is shared by multiple cores.

NANHU communicates with the uncore through 3 AXI interfaces, including the memory port, the DMA port and the peripheral port. It also has clock, reset, and JTAG interfaces. Please refer to the integration guide for more detailed information.

NANHU targets 2GHz@14nm, and 2.4GHz~2.8GHz@7nm.
