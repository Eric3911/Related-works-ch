# SPIR-V Guide Contributing

While open for contributions from all, there are a few contribution rules in place.

The main design goal for the SPIR-V Guide is to be "lean" and prevent any duplication of information. When possible the SPIR-V Guide should guide a user to another resource via a hyperlink.

## Ways on contributing
- Fixing a typo, grammar error, or other minor change
    - Please feel free to make a PR and it will hopefully get merged in quickly.
- Adding new content
    - If you think the guide needs another page, please raise an issue of what topic you feel is missing. This is not a requirement, but don't want people to spend time creating a PR for something that doesn't quite belong in the guides.
    - If adding another link, clarification, or any other small blurb then a PR works. The addition of information needs to not be redundant and add meaningful value to the guide.
- Feel the guide is not accurately portraying a topic
    - There are a lot of ways to use SPIR-V and the guide is aimed to be as objective as possible. This doesn't mean that the current information on the SPIR-V Guide might be slightly incorrect. Please raise an issue what you feel is incorrect and a solution to how you would improve it.

## Images

All images must be no wider than 1080px. This is to force any large images to be resized to a more reasonable size.
